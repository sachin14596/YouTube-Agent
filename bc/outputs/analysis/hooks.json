    "first60_text": "Hi, and welcome to Veritasium, an online science video blog. I'd like to take on scientific topics all the way from the simplest to the most complex. So a good place to start, I think, is with a problem considered by a famous physicist Richard Feynman. He asked if all the world's scientific information, except for one sentence, were destroyed in some cataclysmic event, which single statement would contain the most scientific information for future generations. His conclusion was that it is the atomic hypothesis. The atomic hypothesis states that all things are made up of atoms. Tiny particles that are in perpetual motion, they attract each other when a little distance apart, but repel if squeezed together. That statement is incredibly important to understand if you want to understand most of the rest of science, because everything is made of atoms, including you and me, and the opera hou"

The elements are all the different types of atoms, but different by the number of protons in the middle. Hydrogen is only one, but uranium has a ton. Oh, it's just chemistry that you and me are made of these atoms. Well, atoms bond together to form all the cues, most of what's around in me and you. Water sugar things that I'm dreaming of. Look around, you see the combinations in a eucalyptry. Mandalay was periodicity, gives us sand to water and the air above."
