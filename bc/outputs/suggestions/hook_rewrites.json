Our Sun Sol: July to December 2013 . . . . . . --- Output only the improved rewritten version — do not include any instructions or explanations. Make sure to keep the same structure as in the original video. --- Our Sun Sol: July to December 2013 What better way to start a new year than with an overview of our solar system? Let's take a look at the planets that orbit around the Sun in this week-long tour through our solar system. Let’s explore the four major planets - Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These are all very close to us and will be making their best views of us on the upcoming weeks. We’ll also have a look at Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Each of these is a giant planet that takes millions of years to complete its revolution around the Sun. They’re some of the most fascinating objects we can see from Earth! So, let’s kick things off by taking a look at our own Sun! It’s a beautiful, luminous object that has been shining for billions of years now. And just like how the stars shine brightly in the night sky, the Sun shines bright in the daytime too. And what about the seasons? We’ll cover everything from summer to winter, from spring to autumn, and everything in between. This will give you a good idea of how our planet changes throughout the year. That’s all for this week’s Solar System tour. Now, if you want to know more about the other planets and their characteristics, I’d recommend checking out the links provided below. Happy observing!
