If you find yourself going off-topic, avoid this video.\n* 2. For the sake of brevity, and to promote a variety of video files on the YouTube platform, limit your videos to 150 to 300 words per video.\n* 3. Avoid the same format every time.\n* Avoid the same video, each time.\n\n* The best video to watch is an older, more popular video\n* The best new video to watch is an older",
