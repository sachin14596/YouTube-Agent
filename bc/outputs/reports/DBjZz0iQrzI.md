If you're not sure how to do it, look at the video and think about what you would like to focus on. You will want to focus on the elements. The question of the day, however, is what you can observe and how, because once you're done with that, that will tell you what to focus on later. There are a number of ways to achieve this. I'll talk about the first one here. I think there are three primary ways we can do this. The first one is to look at what's the basic unit of an element. And the basic unit in this is called an atom. So it's the smallest unit of an element. So that will be the element. And then I'm also going to talk about that element, because atoms are the smallest, most fundamental components of matter. In fact, our bodies are made up of atoms, atoms are the smallest unit of an element. So that, naturally, the atoms are arranged in the fewest units. So, of course, these molecules have to have atoms and not be separated by distance. So if I'm sitting in the cafeteria, I'm looking at some chips. And you might think it's just a little bit. But I don't think so. I think it'
