Video Title: I'm Atoms (Scientific Cover of Jason Mraz's I'm Yours)

Transcript snippet:
Well, items made of protons, neutrons, and electron are the first to in the nucleus.
The third around it is mostly empty space, but it feels solid in any case.
The elements are all the different types of atoms, but different by the number of protons in the middle.
Hydrogen is only one, but uranium has a ton.
Oh, it's just chemistry that you and me are made of these atoms.
Well, atoms bond together to form all the cues, most of what's around in me and you.
Water sugar things that I'm dreaming of.
Look around, you see the combinations in a eucalyptry.
Mandalay was periodicity, gives us sand to water and the air above.

Suggest:
1. 3 high-performing YouTube titles (emotional, keyword-rich, curiosity-driven)
2. 3 thumbnail concepts (describe composition, emotion, and contrast)

Output in structured text, clear and concise.
* A lot of videos, but these are my favorites (I'm just a boy, with my face on the side of my head, but I'm not as much of a scientist as most of my audience).
* All are relevant to biology, chemistry, science, or other scientific inquiry and are interesting enough to be shared.
* They're short and brief but not long winded: something that can engage your audience.
* They're not self-indulgent.
* They're not just for the faint-hearted.
* They're about you.
* They're a way to explain ideas to a broad audience.
* You're not trying to sell me anything, but it's nice to find a video that actually makes a clear, coherent, and concise presentation of a science question.
* They could be self-indulgent, but they're fun and engaging.

* 1. If you find yourself going off-topic, avoid this video.
* 2. For the sake of brevity, and to promote a variety of video files on the YouTube platform, limit your videos to 150 to 300 words per video.
* 3. Avoid the same format every time.
* Avoid the same video, each time.

* The best video to watch is an older, more popular video
* The best new video to watch is an older
