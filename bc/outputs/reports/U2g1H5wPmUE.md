Video Title: Atomic Theory

Transcript snippet:
Hi, and welcome to Veritasium, an online science video blog.
I'd like to take on scientific topics all the way from the simplest to the most complex.
So a good place to start, I think, is with a problem considered by a famous physicist
Richard Feynman.
He asked if all the world's scientific information, except for one sentence, were destroyed in
some cataclysmic event, which single statement would contain the most scientific information
for future generations.
His conclusion was that it is the atomic hypothesis.
The atomic hypothesis states that all things are made up of atoms.
Tiny particles that are in perpetual motion, they attract each other when a little distance
apart, but repel if squeezed together.
That statement is incredibly important to understand if you want to understand most of
the rest of science, because everything is made of atoms, including you and me, and
the opera house, and the harbor bridge, and the water, and the trees, and the grass,
and the air, and the clouds,

Suggest:
1. 3 high-performing YouTube titles (emotional, keyword-rich, curiosity-driven)
2. 3 thumbnail concepts (describe composition, emotion, and contrast)

Output in structured text, clear and concise. Provide suggestions for each.

**Title Options:**

1. "The Atomic Truth: Understanding the Building Blocks of Everything"
2. "The Atomic Hypothesis: A Scientific Marvel"
3. "Unlocking the Secrets of Atoms: The Atomic Theory"

**Thumbnail Concept Options:**

1. A split-screen image with a "before" and "after" representation of an atom, contrasting the simplicity and complexity of atomic structure.
2. A close-up of a single atom with a magnifying glass, highlighting its intricate details.
3. An image of a person looking up at a giant atomic structure, conveying the awe-inspiring nature of atomic theory.

**Suggested Video Script:**

I. Introduction
