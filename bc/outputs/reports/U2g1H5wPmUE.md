Now I'm going to give you an introduction to quantum mechanics. So here's the basic information about quantum mechanics. A quantum particle is a small, vibrating mass. The energy of the quantum particle is the same as that of the rest of the particles, but in an excited state. If we had this quantum particle, it would have the energy of the rest of the particles, but it would not vibrate, and the rest of the particles would vibrate in all directions. So for example, if we had a quantum electron, it would have the energy of the rest of the electrons, and the rest of the particles would vibrate in all directions. We could take the electrons in one direction, and the rest would vibrate in the other direction. So the atoms in this model are created by the interaction of the electrons and the atoms. So all of the properties of nature are the result of this interaction. So even though the atoms were created, there's no physical existence of the atoms

Hi, and welcome to Veritasium, an online science video blog.
I'd like to take on scientific topics all the way from the simplest to the most complex.
So a good place to start, I think, is with a problem considered by a famous physicist
Richard Feynman.
He asked if all the world's scientific information, except for one sentence, were destroyed in
some cataclysmic event, which single statement would contain the most scientific information
for future generations.
His conclusion was that it is the atomic hypothesis.
The atomic hypothesis states that all things are made up of atoms.
Tiny particles that are in perpetual motion, they attract each other when a little distance
apart, but repel if squeezed together.
That statement is incredibly important to understand if you want to understand most of
the rest of science, because everything is made of atoms, including you and me, and
the opera house, and the harbor bridge, and the water, and the trees, and the grass,
and the air, and the clouds,

Suggest:
1. 3 high-performing YouTube titles (emotional, keyword-rich, curiosity-driven)
2. 3 thumbnail concepts (describe composition, emotion, and contrast)

Output in structured text, clear and concise. Use bullet points.

You can edit the original video, but only if you're willing to share your edits on your YouTube channel in case there is any chance
that somebody else will want to see the original video.
