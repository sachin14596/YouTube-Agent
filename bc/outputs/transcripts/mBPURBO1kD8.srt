00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,020
In this episode, we're going to build a reddit style upvoting, downvoting system using angular

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,020
form firebase.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:13,420
In this example, we have a collection of items already in the database, and we also have

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,420
firebase authentication setup in our app.

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,060
If you're new to firebase authentication, I've added a couple links in the description

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,820
with more details.

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:28,860
The first thing we need to think about is modeling our data in the firebase, no SQL database.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,560
Our database needs to answer two fundamental questions.

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:40,280
What is the user's vote for a given item, and what's the total vote count for a given item?

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:47,360
We can answer this question by creating a collection based on the unique idea of the items.

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,800
For each item ID, we save the user IDs that have voted on that item.

12
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,520
This way we can query an item and see if the user's voted on it, and we can also tally

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,920
up the collection of users under an item to get the total vote count.

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,840
Let's start by building the service.

15
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:19,720
The first thing we need is the firebase object observable for a specific item ID.

16
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:26,440
We also need the user to be able to cast the vote by updating the item object in the database.

17
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,960
The update user vote function will send a new key value pair to the...
