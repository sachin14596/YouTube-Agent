0	7500	Firebase Storage is now officially supported by Angular Fire 2, which means uploading files
7500	11300	from an Angular application is easier than ever before.
11300	15300	In this episode I'm going to take you through the new features in the Angular Fire 2 storage
15300	20240	module, then we'll use it to build a drop zone file uploader from scratch.
20240	24560	In addition to uploading files to Firebase Storage, it can also control the entire upload
24560	28200	process by pausing, canceling, or resuming an upload.
28600	31760	There's a whole bunch of other cool stuff I want to show you, but first make sure to
31760	36900	like and subscribe and grab the source code from AngularFirebase.com.
36900	40400	Before we jump into the code, I want to give you a few more details about how the Angular
40400	42660	Fire 2 storage module works.
42660	47540	When we drag and drop a file, it's going to start an Angular Fire upload task, which will
47540	51260	immediately start uploading the file to your Firebase storage bucket.
51260	54360	You can then monitor the upload progress as an observable.
54360	58200	The snapshot is emitted several times per second, so you can do things like update your
58200	62040	progress bar or just provide the user with some helpful feedback.
62040	65440	When the process is complete, it will give you back the download URL that you can show
65440	67520	in your front end UI.
67520	69000	Now let's go ahead and build this thing.
69000	73280	We'll start with a brand new Angular Fire app, and then inside that project, install Angular
73280	75520	Fire 2 and Firebase.
75520	80440	Then inside of your Angular environment, add your Firebase project config.
80440	84560	And lastly, we'll go into the app module and initialize our Angular Fire app.
84560	89160	I'm bringing in both the Angular Fire Storage module and the Firestore database for some
89160	90000	advanced stuff I'll show you.
