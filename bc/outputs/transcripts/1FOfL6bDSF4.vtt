I need to start this video off on a sad note.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.000
On New Year's Day, I lost my father unexpectedly at the age of 57.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.040
He lived a good full life, but I just want to remind everybody to enjoy the time you have

00:14.040 --> 00:16.720
with your family because it can end before you know it.

00:16.720 --> 00:20.840
I'd like to say thank you to everybody who supports this project, and I look forward to

00:20.840 --> 00:24.400
bringing you a whole bunch of awesome resources in 2018.

00:24.400 --> 00:28.840
To kick things off, I'm going to give you a quick, angular productivity booster to eliminate

00:28.840 --> 00:33.760
long relative paths that look like this to a single global namespace.

00:33.760 --> 00:37.560
This means you can give all of your feature modules a specific namespace, and you never

00:37.560 --> 00:41.400
really have to worry about relative paths within your project.

00:41.400 --> 00:46.000
To demonstrate this, I'm starting off in a brand new Angular 5 app, and I'm going to generate

00:46.000 --> 00:52.080
a couple of ng modules, first one being core, second one being shared.

00:52.080 --> 00:55.840
From there I'm going to generate a service inside of the core module, we'll just go ahead

00:55.840 --> 00:58.600
and call this the off service.

00:58.600 --> 01:02.480
And I'm going to generate a component, but for no reason at all I'm going to nest this

01:02.480 --> 01:06.400
deeply within the file structure of the project.

01:06.400 --> 01:10.720
Let's go ahead and call it the deeply nested user login component.

01:10.720 --> 01:14.280
Then if we look at the file structure on the left, you can see the actual component file

01:14.280 --> 01:19.040
itself is nested about six levels deep within our project.

01:19.040 --> 01:23.280
This isn't really a problem, unless we need to import this file in a different file that's

01:23.280 --> 01:24.680
nested higher up.

01:24.680 --> 01:28.280
So let's try this by importing the service into the component.

01:28.280 --> 01:29.960
Just a quick side tip here, whenever you...
