0	6280	In 2014, the qualifying exam for the US physics team had this as question 19.
6280	9920	A helicopter is flying horizontally at constant speed.
9920	14120	A perfectly flexible uniform cable is suspended beneath the helicopter.
14120	17440	Air friction on the cable is not negligible.
17440	23840	So which of the following diagrams best shows the shape of the cable as the helicopter flies through the air to the right?
23840	26560	Is it A, hanging straight down?
26560	29000	B, hanging diagonally to the left?
29000	37160	C, this hook shape, D, the inverted hook shape, or E kind of S-bend.
37160	41160	Now, apparently there's been a certain amount of controversy about the correct answer to this question.
41160	48760	So today, we're going to go up in this helicopter and put this question to rest once and for all.
48760	50760	Let's go.
50760	54840	Here, I'm deploying a battle rope, like you'd see at the gym.
54840	59000	This one is about 15 meters long and it weighs 20 kilograms.
59000	61000	Looks pretty good.
61000	64200	To make sure the rope doesn't come up into the rotors of the helicopter,
64200	69640	Pilot Craig wanted to keep the rope on our right side so he could keep an eye on it.
69640	72120	So we're not going straight forward.
72120	75400	We're actually going diagonally forward and to the left.
75400	85400	But you can clearly see the rope is hanging straight diagonally to the left.
85400	89000	That's a pretty good diagonal, man.
