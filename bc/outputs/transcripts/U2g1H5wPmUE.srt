Hi, and welcome to Veritasium, an online science video blog.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,720
I'd like to take on scientific topics all the way from the simplest to the most complex.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:19,920
So a good place to start, I think, is with a problem considered by a famous physicist

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,840
Richard Feynman.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:29,000
He asked if all the world's scientific information, except for one sentence, were destroyed in

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,480
some cataclysmic event, which single statement would contain the most scientific information

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,120
for future generations.

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,280
His conclusion was that it is the atomic hypothesis.

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,520
The atomic hypothesis states that all things are made up of atoms.

10
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,160
Tiny particles that are in perpetual motion, they attract each other when a little distance

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,840
apart, but repel if squeezed together.

12
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,240
That statement is incredibly important to understand if you want to understand most of

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,440
the rest of science, because everything is made of atoms, including you and me, and

14
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,760
the opera house, and the harbor bridge, and the water, and the trees, and the grass,

15
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,280
and the air, and the clouds, and, well, you get the idea.

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,520
Everything is made out of atoms, so it's really important to understand the atomic concept

17
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,560
if you're going to understand the rest of science.

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,960
The idea that...
