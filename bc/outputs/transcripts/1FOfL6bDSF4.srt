00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
I need to start this video off on a sad note.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,000
On New Year's Day, I lost my father unexpectedly at the age of 57.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,040
He lived a good full life, but I just want to remind everybody to enjoy the time you have

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,720
with your family because it can end before you know it.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,840
I'd like to say thank you to everybody who supports this project, and I look forward to

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,400
bringing you a whole bunch of awesome resources in 2018.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,840
To kick things off, I'm going to give you a quick, angular productivity booster to eliminate

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,760
long relative paths that look like this to a single global namespace.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,560
This means you can give all of your feature modules a specific namespace, and you never

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,400
really have to worry about relative paths within your project.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,000
To demonstrate this, I'm starting off in a brand new Angular 5 app, and I'm going to generate

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,080
a couple of ng modules, first one being core, second one being shared.

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,840
From there I'm going to generate a service inside of the core module, we'll just go ahead

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,600
and call this the off service.

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,480
And I'm going to generate a component, but for no reason at all I'm going to nest this

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,400
deeply within the file structure of the project.

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,720
Let's go ahead and call it the deeply nested user login component.

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,280
Then if we look at the file structure on the left, you can see the actual component file

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,040
itself is nested about six levels deep within our project.

20
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,280
This isn't really a problem, unless we need to import this file in a different file that's

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,680
nested higher up.

22
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,280
So let's try this by importing the service into the component.

23
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,960
Just a quick side tip here, whenever you...
