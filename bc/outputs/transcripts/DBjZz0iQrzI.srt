1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Well, items made of protons, neutrons, and electron are the first to in the nucleus.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The third around it is mostly empty space, but it feels solid in any case.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The elements are all the different types of atoms, but different by the number of protons in the middle.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hydrogen is only one, but uranium has a ton.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Oh, it's just chemistry that you and me are made of these atoms.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, atoms bond together to form all the cues, most of what's around in me and you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Water sugar things that I'm dreaming of.

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Look around, you see the combinations in a eucalyptry.

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Mandalay was periodicity, gives us sand to water and the air above.
