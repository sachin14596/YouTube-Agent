The third around it is mostly empty space, but it feels solid in any case.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
The elements are all the different types of atoms, but different by the number of protons in the middle.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
Hydrogen is only one, but uranium has a ton.

00:39.000 --> 00:53.000
Oh, it's just chemistry that you and me are made of these atoms.

00:58.000 --> 01:12.000
Well, atoms bond together to form all the cues, most of what's around in me and you.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
Water sugar things that I'm dreaming of.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
Look around, you see the combinations in a eucalyptry.
