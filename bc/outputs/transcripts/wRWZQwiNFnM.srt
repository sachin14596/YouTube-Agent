00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Firebase Storage is now officially supported by Angular Fire 2, which means uploading files

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,300
from an Angular application is easier than ever before.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,300
In this episode I'm going to take you through the new features in the Angular Fire 2 storage

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,240
module, then we'll use it to build a drop zone file uploader from scratch.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,560
In addition to uploading files to Firebase Storage, it can also control the entire upload

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,200
process by pausing, canceling, or resuming an upload.

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,760
There's a whole bunch of other cool stuff I want to show you, but first make sure to

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,900
like and subscribe and grab the source code from AngularFirebase.com.

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,400
Before we jump into the code, I want to give you a few more details about how the Angular

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,660
Fire 2 storage module works.

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,540
When we drag and drop a file, it's going to start an Angular Fire upload task, which will

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,260
immediately start uploading the file to your Firebase storage bucket.

13
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,360
You can then monitor the upload progress as an observable.

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,200
The snapshot is emitted several times per second, so you can do things like update your

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,040
progress bar or just provide the user with some helpful feedback.

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,440
When the process is complete, it will give you back the download URL that you can show

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,520
in your front end UI.

18
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,000
Now let's go ahead and build this thing.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,280
We'll start with a brand new Angular Fire app, and then inside that project, install Angular

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,520
Fire 2 and Firebase.

21
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,440
Then inside of your Angular environment, add your Firebase project config.

22
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,560
And lastly, we'll go into the app module and initialize our Angular Fire app.

23
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,160
I'm bringing in both the Angular Fire Storage module and the Firestore database for some

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,000
advanced stuff I'll show you.
