0	7520	Hi, and welcome to Veritasium, an online science video blog.
7520	13720	I'd like to take on scientific topics all the way from the simplest to the most complex.
13720	19920	So a good place to start, I think, is with a problem considered by a famous physicist
19920	21840	Richard Feynman.
21840	29000	He asked if all the world's scientific information, except for one sentence, were destroyed in
29000	36480	some cataclysmic event, which single statement would contain the most scientific information
36480	39120	for future generations.
39120	46280	His conclusion was that it is the atomic hypothesis.
46280	51520	The atomic hypothesis states that all things are made up of atoms.
51520	57160	Tiny particles that are in perpetual motion, they attract each other when a little distance
57160	61840	apart, but repel if squeezed together.
61840	66240	That statement is incredibly important to understand if you want to understand most of
66240	72440	the rest of science, because everything is made of atoms, including you and me, and
72440	76760	the opera house, and the harbor bridge, and the water, and the trees, and the grass,
76760	81280	and the air, and the clouds, and, well, you get the idea.
81280	85520	Everything is made out of atoms, so it's really important to understand the atomic concept
85560	88560	if you're going to understand the rest of science.
88560	89960	The idea that...
