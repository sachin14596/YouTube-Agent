Hey everyone, welcome back to Mentor and yet another rerun show from my earlier episodes

00:13.840 --> 00:17.840
that I did on my earlier YouTube channel.

00:17.840 --> 00:22.480
This one is about first of the programs, paid to fly programs and buying your own type

00:22.480 --> 00:23.480
rating.

00:23.480 --> 00:24.480
I hope you enjoy it.

00:24.480 --> 00:29.320
There wouldn't be new content coming out maybe early next week or so.

00:29.320 --> 00:32.760
But up until then you'll have to make do with all my earlier shows.

00:32.760 --> 00:36.960
So please sit back, relax and enjoy it, thank you.

00:36.960 --> 00:44.120
So I have been receiving a couple of questions during this week and before that as well about

00:44.120 --> 00:51.040
first officer programs or paid to fly programs and also to pay for type ratings if that's

00:51.040 --> 00:52.920
a good idea or not.

00:52.920 --> 00:57.160
And before I start I just want to say that I don't have much experience at all when it

00:57.160 --> 01:00.600
comes to paid to fly programs or first of the programs.

01:00.600 --> 01:05.040
I do have experience of paying for my own type rating however.

01:05.040 --> 01:15.200
So first of the programs, well what they are is essentially a airline or several airlines

01:15.200 --> 01:22.480
that are offering low hours just out of school flying cadets the possibility to come in

01:22.480 --> 01:29.000
and work for that airline for a limited amount of time, normally up to 100 or 500 or even

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
up to a thousand hours.
