Hi, and welcome to Veritasium, an online science video blog.

00:07.520 --> 00:13.720
I'd like to take on scientific topics all the way from the simplest to the most complex.

00:13.720 --> 00:19.920
So a good place to start, I think, is with a problem considered by a famous physicist

00:19.920 --> 00:21.840
Richard Feynman.

00:21.840 --> 00:29.000
He asked if all the world's scientific information, except for one sentence, were destroyed in

00:29.000 --> 00:36.480
some cataclysmic event, which single statement would contain the most scientific information

00:36.480 --> 00:39.120
for future generations.

00:39.120 --> 00:46.280
His conclusion was that it is the atomic hypothesis.

00:46.280 --> 00:51.520
The atomic hypothesis states that all things are made up of atoms.

00:51.520 --> 00:57.160
Tiny particles that are in perpetual motion, they attract each other when a little distance

00:57.160 --> 01:01.840
apart, but repel if squeezed together.

01:01.840 --> 01:06.240
That statement is incredibly important to understand if you want to understand most of

01:06.240 --> 01:12.440
the rest of science, because everything is made of atoms, including you and me, and

01:12.440 --> 01:16.760
the opera house, and the harbor bridge, and the water, and the trees, and the grass,

01:16.760 --> 01:21.280
and the air, and the clouds, and, well, you get the idea.

01:21.280 --> 01:25.520
Everything is made out of atoms, so it's really important to understand the atomic concept

01:25.560 --> 01:28.560
if you're going to understand the rest of science.

01:28.560 --> 01:29.960
The idea that...
