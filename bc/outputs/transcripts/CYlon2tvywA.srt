00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
In 1999, the German newspaper Dezite ran an experiment.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,840
They asked a falafel salesman and former theater director,

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,080
Salah Ben Galli, who in the world he would most like

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,360
to be connected to.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,520
He chose his favorite actor, Marlon Brando.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,640
So the reporters then searched for a chain of friends,

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,320
family, or acquaintances, people who knew each other

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,400
on a first-name basis, who could connect Ben Galli to Brando.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,560
As it happens, Ben Galli had a friend in California.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,880
This friend worked alongside the boyfriend of a woman

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,040
who was the sorority sister of the daughter of the producer

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,360
of the film Don Juan de Marco, starring Marlon Brando.

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,840
So in total, it took just six steps,

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,960
six degrees of separation.

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,000
And the idea is that this is not a unique example,

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,520
that you could connect any two people on the planet

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,600
in six steps or less.

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,320
But is it really true?

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,160
And if it is, how does it affect our lives?

20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,600
How is this possible in a world of now eight billion people

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,560
that we could be that close, just six hops or less?

22
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,600
Does that affect how diseases spread,

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,520
how information travels?

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,480
Our math showed the question is not why is the world small?

25
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,560
It's really how could it be otherwise?

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,400
But then I got a call from the FBI.

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,560
We are making the world smaller all the time.

28
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,840
I could suppose to be good.

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,080
And yet it does expose you to toxicity and malevolence

30
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,840
that you might have been shielded from.

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,640
You look at the net effect of it.

32
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,240
And it's actually been pretty negative by a lot of...
