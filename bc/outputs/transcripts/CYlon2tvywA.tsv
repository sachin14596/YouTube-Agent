0	4480	In 1999, the German newspaper Dezite ran an experiment.
4480	7840	They asked a falafel salesman and former theater director,
7840	11080	Salah Ben Galli, who in the world he would most like
11080	12360	to be connected to.
12360	15520	He chose his favorite actor, Marlon Brando.
15520	18640	So the reporters then searched for a chain of friends,
18640	21320	family, or acquaintances, people who knew each other
21320	25400	on a first-name basis, who could connect Ben Galli to Brando.
25400	28560	As it happens, Ben Galli had a friend in California.
28560	31880	This friend worked alongside the boyfriend of a woman
31880	35040	who was the sorority sister of the daughter of the producer
35040	39360	of the film Don Juan de Marco, starring Marlon Brando.
39360	41840	So in total, it took just six steps,
41840	43960	six degrees of separation.
43960	47000	And the idea is that this is not a unique example,
47000	49520	that you could connect any two people on the planet
49520	51600	in six steps or less.
51600	53320	But is it really true?
53320	57160	And if it is, how does it affect our lives?
57160	60600	How is this possible in a world of now eight billion people
60600	63560	that we could be that close, just six hops or less?
63560	65600	Does that affect how diseases spread,
65600	67520	how information travels?
67520	70480	Our math showed the question is not why is the world small?
70480	72560	It's really how could it be otherwise?
72560	75400	But then I got a call from the FBI.
76640	79560	We are making the world smaller all the time.
79560	80840	I could suppose to be good.
80840	84080	And yet it does expose you to toxicity and malevolence
84080	85840	that you might have been shielded from.
85840	87640	You look at the net effect of it.
87640	90240	And it's actually been pretty negative by a lot of...
