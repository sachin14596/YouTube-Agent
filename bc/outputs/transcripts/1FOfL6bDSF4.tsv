0	5520	I need to start this video off on a sad note.
5520	10000	On New Year's Day, I lost my father unexpectedly at the age of 57.
10000	14040	He lived a good full life, but I just want to remind everybody to enjoy the time you have
14040	16720	with your family because it can end before you know it.
16720	20840	I'd like to say thank you to everybody who supports this project, and I look forward to
20840	24400	bringing you a whole bunch of awesome resources in 2018.
24400	28840	To kick things off, I'm going to give you a quick, angular productivity booster to eliminate
28840	33760	long relative paths that look like this to a single global namespace.
33760	37560	This means you can give all of your feature modules a specific namespace, and you never
37560	41400	really have to worry about relative paths within your project.
41400	46000	To demonstrate this, I'm starting off in a brand new Angular 5 app, and I'm going to generate
46000	52080	a couple of ng modules, first one being core, second one being shared.
52080	55840	From there I'm going to generate a service inside of the core module, we'll just go ahead
55840	58600	and call this the off service.
58600	62480	And I'm going to generate a component, but for no reason at all I'm going to nest this
62480	66400	deeply within the file structure of the project.
66400	70720	Let's go ahead and call it the deeply nested user login component.
70720	74280	Then if we look at the file structure on the left, you can see the actual component file
74280	79040	itself is nested about six levels deep within our project.
79040	83280	This isn't really a problem, unless we need to import this file in a different file that's
83280	84680	nested higher up.
84680	88280	So let's try this by importing the service into the component.
88280	89960	Just a quick side tip here, whenever you...
