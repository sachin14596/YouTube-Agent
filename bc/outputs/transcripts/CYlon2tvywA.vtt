In 1999, the German newspaper Dezite ran an experiment.

00:04.480 --> 00:07.840
They asked a falafel salesman and former theater director,

00:07.840 --> 00:11.080
Salah Ben Galli, who in the world he would most like

00:11.080 --> 00:12.360
to be connected to.

00:12.360 --> 00:15.520
He chose his favorite actor, Marlon Brando.

00:15.520 --> 00:18.640
So the reporters then searched for a chain of friends,

00:18.640 --> 00:21.320
family, or acquaintances, people who knew each other

00:21.320 --> 00:25.400
on a first-name basis, who could connect Ben Galli to Brando.

00:25.400 --> 00:28.560
As it happens, Ben Galli had a friend in California.

00:28.560 --> 00:31.880
This friend worked alongside the boyfriend of a woman

00:31.880 --> 00:35.040
who was the sorority sister of the daughter of the producer

00:35.040 --> 00:39.360
of the film Don Juan de Marco, starring Marlon Brando.

00:39.360 --> 00:41.840
So in total, it took just six steps,

00:41.840 --> 00:43.960
six degrees of separation.

00:43.960 --> 00:47.000
And the idea is that this is not a unique example,

00:47.000 --> 00:49.520
that you could connect any two people on the planet

00:49.520 --> 00:51.600
in six steps or less.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.320
But is it really true?

00:53.320 --> 00:57.160
And if it is, how does it affect our lives?

00:57.160 --> 01:00.600
How is this possible in a world of now eight billion people

01:00.600 --> 01:03.560
that we could be that close, just six hops or less?

01:03.560 --> 01:05.600
Does that affect how diseases spread,

01:05.600 --> 01:07.520
how information travels?

01:07.520 --> 01:10.480
Our math showed the question is not why is the world small?

01:10.480 --> 01:12.560
It's really how could it be otherwise?

01:12.560 --> 01:15.400
But then I got a call from the FBI.

01:16.640 --> 01:19.560
We are making the world smaller all the time.

01:19.560 --> 01:20.840
I could suppose to be good.

01:20.840 --> 01:24.080
And yet it does expose you to toxicity and malevolence

01:24.080 --> 01:25.840
that you might have been shielded from.

01:25.840 --> 01:27.640
You look at the net effect of it.

01:27.640 --> 01:30.240
And it's actually been pretty negative by a lot of...
