00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
In 2014, the qualifying exam for the US physics team had this as question 19.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,920
A helicopter is flying horizontally at constant speed.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,120
A perfectly flexible uniform cable is suspended beneath the helicopter.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,440
Air friction on the cable is not negligible.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,840
So which of the following diagrams best shows the shape of the cable as the helicopter flies through the air to the right?

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,560
Is it A, hanging straight down?

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,000
B, hanging diagonally to the left?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,160
C, this hook shape, D, the inverted hook shape, or E kind of S-bend.

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,160
Now, apparently there's been a certain amount of controversy about the correct answer to this question.

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:48,760
So today, we're going to go up in this helicopter and put this question to rest once and for all.

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,760
Let's go.

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,840
Here, I'm deploying a battle rope, like you'd see at the gym.

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,000
This one is about 15 meters long and it weighs 20 kilograms.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Looks pretty good.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,200
To make sure the rope doesn't come up into the rotors of the helicopter,

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,640
Pilot Craig wanted to keep the rope on our right side so he could keep an eye on it.

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,120
So we're not going straight forward.

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,400
We're actually going diagonally forward and to the left.

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:25,400
But you can clearly see the rope is hanging straight diagonally to the left.

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,000
That's a pretty good diagonal, man.
