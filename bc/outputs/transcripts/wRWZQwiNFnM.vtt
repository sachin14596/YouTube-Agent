Firebase Storage is now officially supported by Angular Fire 2, which means uploading files

00:07.500 --> 00:11.300
from an Angular application is easier than ever before.

00:11.300 --> 00:15.300
In this episode I'm going to take you through the new features in the Angular Fire 2 storage

00:15.300 --> 00:20.240
module, then we'll use it to build a drop zone file uploader from scratch.

00:20.240 --> 00:24.560
In addition to uploading files to Firebase Storage, it can also control the entire upload

00:24.560 --> 00:28.200
process by pausing, canceling, or resuming an upload.

00:28.600 --> 00:31.760
There's a whole bunch of other cool stuff I want to show you, but first make sure to

00:31.760 --> 00:36.900
like and subscribe and grab the source code from AngularFirebase.com.

00:36.900 --> 00:40.400
Before we jump into the code, I want to give you a few more details about how the Angular

00:40.400 --> 00:42.660
Fire 2 storage module works.

00:42.660 --> 00:47.540
When we drag and drop a file, it's going to start an Angular Fire upload task, which will

00:47.540 --> 00:51.260
immediately start uploading the file to your Firebase storage bucket.

00:51.260 --> 00:54.360
You can then monitor the upload progress as an observable.

00:54.360 --> 00:58.200
The snapshot is emitted several times per second, so you can do things like update your

00:58.200 --> 01:02.040
progress bar or just provide the user with some helpful feedback.

01:02.040 --> 01:05.440
When the process is complete, it will give you back the download URL that you can show

01:05.440 --> 01:07.520
in your front end UI.

01:07.520 --> 01:09.000
Now let's go ahead and build this thing.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.280
We'll start with a brand new Angular Fire app, and then inside that project, install Angular

01:13.280 --> 01:15.520
Fire 2 and Firebase.

01:15.520 --> 01:20.440
Then inside of your Angular environment, add your Firebase project config.

01:20.440 --> 01:24.560
And lastly, we'll go into the app module and initialize our Angular Fire app.

01:24.560 --> 01:29.160
I'm bringing in both the Angular Fire Storage module and the Firestore database for some

01:29.160 --> 01:30.000
advanced stuff I'll show you.
