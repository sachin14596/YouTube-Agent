0	13840	Hey everyone, welcome back to Mentor and yet another rerun show from my earlier episodes
13840	17840	that I did on my earlier YouTube channel.
17840	22480	This one is about first of the programs, paid to fly programs and buying your own type
22480	23480	rating.
23480	24480	I hope you enjoy it.
24480	29320	There wouldn't be new content coming out maybe early next week or so.
29320	32760	But up until then you'll have to make do with all my earlier shows.
32760	36960	So please sit back, relax and enjoy it, thank you.
36960	44120	So I have been receiving a couple of questions during this week and before that as well about
44120	51040	first officer programs or paid to fly programs and also to pay for type ratings if that's
51040	52920	a good idea or not.
52920	57160	And before I start I just want to say that I don't have much experience at all when it
57160	60600	comes to paid to fly programs or first of the programs.
60600	65040	I do have experience of paying for my own type rating however.
65040	75200	So first of the programs, well what they are is essentially a airline or several airlines
75200	82480	that are offering low hours just out of school flying cadets the possibility to come in
82480	89000	and work for that airline for a limited amount of time, normally up to 100 or 500 or even
89000	90000	up to a thousand hours.
