00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,840
Hey everyone, welcome back to Mentor and yet another rerun show from my earlier episodes

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,840
that I did on my earlier YouTube channel.

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,480
This one is about first of the programs, paid to fly programs and buying your own type

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,480
rating.

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,480
I hope you enjoy it.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,320
There wouldn't be new content coming out maybe early next week or so.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,760
But up until then you'll have to make do with all my earlier shows.

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,960
So please sit back, relax and enjoy it, thank you.

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,120
So I have been receiving a couple of questions during this week and before that as well about

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:51,040
first officer programs or paid to fly programs and also to pay for type ratings if that's

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,920
a good idea or not.

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,160
And before I start I just want to say that I don't have much experience at all when it

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,600
comes to paid to fly programs or first of the programs.

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,040
I do have experience of paying for my own type rating however.

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:15,200
So first of the programs, well what they are is essentially a airline or several airlines

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:22,480
that are offering low hours just out of school flying cadets the possibility to come in

17
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:29,000
and work for that airline for a limited amount of time, normally up to 100 or 500 or even

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
up to a thousand hours.
